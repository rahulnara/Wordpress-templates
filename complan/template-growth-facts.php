        <h3>The Story Of Complan</h3>
        <p>The origin of the brand goes back to around 1942, during Second World War, when Complan was developed as means to provide complete nutrition to soldiers during battle where they carried very limited dry ration. The concept was so popular and successful that eventually Complan was also recommended as a meal replacement for patients with problems in food intake.
        In India the concept was developed as a Complete nourishment for Children aged 6-14 years as a supplementary Food. And it has been now more than 5 decades since Complan became a trusted part of Indian households.</p>
